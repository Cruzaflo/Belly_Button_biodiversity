# Belly_Button_biodiversity

For this project, an HTML page was created to display results of a belly button biodiversity dataset. The dataset is a catalog of microbes that colonize human navels. 
  
App.js was created to display the data on the HTML page. Plotly was used to create the horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart displayed on the HTML page.
